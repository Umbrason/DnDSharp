Refactor everything to work with a Operation/Event based pattern.
Events get funneled through a centralized Channel so everyone can react to anything thats going on.

Concrete shit this refactor affects => 
- no events/actions in Character.cs
- centralized event channel in some CS-class, ~~maybe combat?~~ no do some kind of event channel/world/whatever class that can also function as a log
